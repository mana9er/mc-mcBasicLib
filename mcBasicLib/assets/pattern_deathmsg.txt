blew up
burned to death
death.fell.accident.water
didn't want to live
died
discovered the floor
drowned
experienced kinetic energy
fell
froze to death
hit the ground too hard
left the confines of this world
starved to death
suffocated in a wall
tried to swim in lava
walked into
was
went off with a bang
went up in flames
withered away
